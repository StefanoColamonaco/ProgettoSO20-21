# ProgettoSO20-21
First part of the operating systems project for the year 2020/2021.
This phase is dedicated to the construction of fundamental data structures for the management of processes. Specifically a PCB (Process Control Block) list and a PCB tree. 
In addition, the semd_t type was used to create a list of semaphores for process management, each with a value and a list of blocked PCBs.
